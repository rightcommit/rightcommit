# Installing rightcommit with Podman

rightcommit supports one or more users with separate settings and agent homes. Pi, Codex
and Claude Code are available to every user. Before connecting an agent, read
[Provider terms and permitted use](PROVIDER_TERMS.md).

Podman is a free alternative to Docker. It runs rightcommit with everything included, on
**macOS, Windows or Linux**. To use Docker instead, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

**You need:** a 64-bit computer, an Internet connection and about 20–30 minutes.

## Step 1 — Install Podman

### macOS

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), in Terminal:

```sh
brew install podman podman-compose
podman machine init --memory 6144
podman machine start
```

The `podman machine` commands create the small Linux machine Podman runs in; 6 GB of memory
lets it build the app. You only run `init` once.

### Windows

You need 64-bit Windows 10 or 11.

1. Download and install [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/).
2. Open it and follow the first-start setup: let it install **Podman** and **Compose**,
   and create the Podman machine. If it asks to enable or update WSL, accept and restart.

### Linux

On Ubuntu or Debian:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y podman podman-compose
```

On Fedora:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y podman podman-compose
```

On Linux there is no Podman machine to create.

## Step 2 — Download rightcommit

1. On the [project's GitHub page](https://github.com/rightcommit/rightcommit) click **Code** → **Download ZIP**.
2. Extract the ZIP file (double-click on macOS; right-click → **Extract All** on Windows).

## Step 3 — Start the app

Open a terminal in the extracted folder (the one that contains **compose.yaml**):

- **macOS or Linux:** in the terminal type `cd ` (with a space), drag the folder into the
  window and press **Return**.
- **Windows:** in File Explorer right-click an empty area of the folder → **Open in Terminal**.

Then run:

```sh
podman compose up -d --build
```

The first time this can take 10–30 minutes. When the cursor comes back the app is running,
and you can close the terminal.

## Step 4 — Open the app

1. Open your browser at **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**.
2. Create the first account with an email and a password: it becomes the **administrator**.
3. Open **Agents and connections**, paste the API key of the agent you want to use
   (Codex, Claude Code or Pi) and save.

Done: you can create your first workflow.

## Everyday use

Run these commands from the rightcommit folder. On macOS and Windows, the Podman machine
must be running: if it is off, run `podman machine start` (or start it from Podman Desktop).

- **Stop the app:** `podman compose down`
- **Start it again:** `podman compose up -d`
- **Update it** after downloading a new version: `podman compose up -d --build`
- **See errors:** `podman compose logs --tail=100`

> ⚠️ Never use `podman compose down -v`: it **deletes all the app's data**
> (the `rightcommit-data` volume).

## Your own project folders

To work on folders from your computer, put them in the `sources` folder inside the
rightcommit folder, then use a **Source** node of type **Folder in /sources**.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| `Cannot connect to Podman` (macOS or Windows) | The Podman machine is off. Run `podman machine start`, or start it from Podman Desktop. |
| `podman compose` says no compose provider is installed | macOS and Linux: install `podman-compose` (step 1). Windows: install Compose from Podman Desktop. |
| The build stops with an out-of-memory error (macOS) | Give the machine more memory: `podman machine stop`, `podman machine set --memory 6144`, `podman machine start`. |
| The `localhost:8080` page doesn't open | Check that the app is running, then look at the errors with `podman compose logs --tail=100`. |
| Error about port 8080 already in use | Another app, or Docker running rightcommit, is using the port. Stop it. |
| Windows: the build fails with errors about `install-twg.sh` or `\r` | Your copy was downloaded before line endings were fixed. Download the project again. |

## Next steps

- Give the Pi agent extra tools: [ADD-PI-PACKAGES.md](ADD-PI-PACKAGES.md)
- Add a skill to all agents: [ADD_A_SKILL.md](ADD_A_SKILL.md)
- Use Spec Kit, OpenSpec or another framework with your project: [ADD-A-FRAMEWORK.md](ADD-A-FRAMEWORK.md)
