## Quickstart

### Docker

Start Docker, then run the command below to clone and start rightcommit.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rightcommit/rightcommit.git && cd rightcommit && docker compose up -d --build
```

The first build can take several minutes. For a ZIP download or step-by-step instructions, see the
[Docker install guide](INSTALL.md).

### Homebrew on macOS

```sh
brew install rightcommit/tap/rightcommit
mkdir -p ~/rightcommit && cd ~/rightcommit
rightcommit setup
rightcommit
```

Run `rightcommit setup` once to install the agents. Launch `rightcommit` from the same folder
on future starts to reuse your data. See the [macOS install guide](INSTALL_MAC.md).

### Run your first workflow

1. Open <http://localhost:8080>. The first account becomes the administrator, and public sign-up
   closes by default.
2. In **Personal settings → Agents**, configure an API key or authorized provider for at least
   one agent and pick a model. See [Configuring the agents](#configuring-the-agents).
3. Press **+** to pick a ready-made workflow, or describe one to the **Project Manager**. Check
   the draft on the canvas and run it.

**[Star rightcommit](https://github.com/rightcommit/rightcommit)** if you find it useful.

or see [how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why rightcommit

- **Verified commits.** Build workflows that require passing tests, agent review, and human
  approval before a commit.
- **Coordinated agents.** Assign Claude Code, Codex, or Pi to different steps in the same workflow.
- **Transparent costs.** See costs and tokens by agent, model, and run in FinOps.

## What you get

- **Agentic workflow orchestration.** Design and run workflows that combine AI agents
  and tools. Workflows can be exposed as A2A-compatible agents.
- **Quality gates.** Check that tasks are closed, run tests on the server, and recheck
  results when files change after testing.
- **Traceable work.** Every step saves its files as versions with a SHA-256 fingerprint and
  a line-by-line diff. Failed checks send the work back for correction, within a set number
  of attempts.
- **A workflow that fits the job.** Three steps or a full delivery pipeline. Start from one
  of the ready-made workflows, such as Spec Kit specification → plan → tasks → implementation,
  or build your own.
- **You stay in control.** Run interactively, assisted or unattended. Pause for human
  decisions and resume where you left off.
- **Not only code.** The same blocks can run research, document analysis or reporting workflows.

## Connections

- **Agents:** Claude Code, Codex and Pi, with an API key or an authorized gateway (Anthropic,
  OpenAI, OpenRouter, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, Microsoft Foundry and more).
- **Services:** GitHub, Azure DevOps, ServiceNow, and Jira, Confluence and Bitbucket through
  the Atlassian CLI. Every write to an outside system waits for your confirmation of the
  exact content.
- **Open standards:** MCP to give agents tools from your MCP servers, and A2A to publish a
  workflow that other agents can call.

## Who it's for

rightcommit supports individual use and internal organizational deployments with separate
user accounts. Read [Provider terms and permitted use](PROVIDER_TERMS.md) and
[Intended use and third-party provider obligations](INTENDED_USE.md). Provider names identify integrations
and do not imply affiliation or endorsement.

- **Developers** running agents on their own laptop, with their own keys.
- **Small teams** who prefer to self-host, with separate users, keys and workspaces.

## Other ways to install

| Guide | For |
|---|---|
| [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) | Docker on macOS, Windows and Linux, step by step |
| [INSTALL_MAC.md](INSTALL_MAC.md) | macOS without containers: Homebrew, crates.io or source |
| [INSTALL_LINUX.md](INSTALL_LINUX.md) | Linux and WSL2 without containers: crates.io or source |
| [INSTALL_PODMAN.md](INSTALL_PODMAN.md) | Podman instead of Docker |

### Managing the Docker install

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Stop the app | `docker compose down` |
| Update after getting a new version | `docker compose up -d --build` |
| Use another port | set `RIGHTCOMMIT_PORT=9090` in a `.env` file, then `docker compose up -d` |

> [!WARNING]
> Never run `docker compose down -v`: it deletes the `rightcommit-data` volume, with all
> accounts, workflows and keys.

By default, Docker Compose binds the app to localhost.

## Configuring the agents

Start with [Provider terms and permitted use](PROVIDER_TERMS.md). All three agents support multiple users;
provider authorization and credential scope still apply.

| Guide | Covers |
|---|---|
| [HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_CLAUDECODE.md](HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_CLAUDECODE.md) | Claude Code: API keys, gateways, Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry |
| [HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_CODEX.md](HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_CODEX.md) | Codex: API keys and compatible provider configuration |
| [HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_PI.md](HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_PI.md) | Pi with Anthropic or OpenAI |
| [HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_PI_OPENROUTER.md](HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_PI_OPENROUTER.md) | Pi with OpenRouter |
| [HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_PI_LOCAL.md](HOW_TO_CONFIGURE_PI_LOCAL.md) | Pi with a local model (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM) |
